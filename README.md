How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this? 

  I interpret user needs on a case-to-case basis; I implement them into the program to ensure that the user gets the product that they need. By talking to users, I can create user stories to keep track of what the user is looking for, this will help the team focus on the project. 

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work? 

  My approach to developing programs is to take little bites out of each problem, a good agile process to this would be the tee shirt method or poker method. I hope in my coding journey that I will be able to use all agile methods. 

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development? 

	I think that a good team member would be able to work with all other team members for the same goal, that of which being making the best product for the end user.
